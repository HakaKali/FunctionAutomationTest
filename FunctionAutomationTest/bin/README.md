## Binary Files

### main.o

The `main.o` file is an object file generated during the compilation process. It contains the compiled code for the `main` function defined in `main.c`. This object file is used during the linking stage to create the final executable.

### project

The `project` file is the final executable generated by the compilation and linking process. It is the result of combining the object files `main.o` and `utils.o`. Running this executable triggers the execution of the automated tests on the specified function.

### utils.o

The `utils.o` file is an object file generated during the compilation process. It contains the compiled code for the utility functions defined in `utils.c`. These utility functions are used by the main function for performing various operations required for the automated testing.

These binary files are essential for executing the automated tests on the target function. They represent the compiled and linked code that carries out the testing process.
