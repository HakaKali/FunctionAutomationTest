## Source Files

### main.c

The `main.c` file is the entry point of the program. It includes the `project.h` header file and contains the `main` function. In this file, the `create_test_cases_file` and `run_test_cases` functions are called to generate test cases and execute the automated tests.

### project.h

The `project.h` file is a header file that contains function declarations and any necessary includes. It provides the function prototypes for the `add`, `create_test_cases_file`, and `run_test_cases` functions used in the project.

### utils.c

The `utils.c` file contains the implementation of the `add` function and other utility functions if any. The `add` function takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

These source files work together to create an automated testing framework for a specific function.
